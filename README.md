## Hi! 🐉

I am currently trying to come to terms with the fact that in order to sleep, you need to NOT sleep beforehand. 💤

- Music enthusiast 🎶
- Gamer at heart 🎮 
- Sports fan 🏆
- Proud black cat owner 🐈 (or rather a proud human owned by a black cat) 😶

Remember folks:\
Life before death. Strength before weakness. Journey before destination. 🙏
